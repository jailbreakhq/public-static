# JailbreakHQ 2015 Public Static
A single-page backbone static app for jailbreakhq.org

### Language Support
* Coffescript
* Jade Templates
* SASS

### Frameworks
* Foundation CSS
* Backbone

###Â Tools
* Grunt 
* Bower for static dependency management
* Travis config setup


## Development
#### Setup
First step is to setup the development environment. You need to have node, npm and bower installed. Then run in the root of this repository to install all development dependencies.

```
./setup.sh
```

#### Developing
In a terminal window run and leave running while developing:

```
grunt watch
```

This starts the Grunt filewatcher that will generate the output of the coffeescript, sass, and jade files whenever you change them. Otherwise when you change source files they will have no affect.

### Structure
* Front-end components should be installed using bower
* The coffeescript, sass and jade sources files are inside `assets/src`
